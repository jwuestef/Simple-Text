# Simple Text
This website is designed for elderly computer users, to allow them to communicate with non-smartphone users. When users sign up, (*signup currently disabled) they are assigned a unique phone number. Users can add names and phone numbers to their contact list, and then send plain-text text messages to those contacts. When contacts reply, the reply is shown to the user.
